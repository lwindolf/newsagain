# NewsAgain

![NewsAgain Icon](icons/web/icon-192.png)

WIP prototype for a backend-less PWA feed reader replacing [Liferea](https://lzone.de/liferea)

Please note that running a PWA feed reader requires using a CORS proxy which has some
security implications.

## Start using it

Just open [https://lwindolf.github.io/newsagain](https://lwindolf.github.io/newsagain)

Alternatively host it yourself by uploading the `www` folder on your own webserver.

## Building

    npm install
    npm test
    npm run build       # To install NPM dependencies into assets/js/lib
    npx serve
