# NewsAgain

![NewsAgain Icon](icons/web/icon-192.png)

WIP prototype for a backend-less PWA feed reader replacing [Liferea](https://lzone.de/liferea)

Can be used as an

- Electron app
- Android app

While NewsAgain is technically a PWA as a feed reader it cannot be run in
a normal browser as most websites do deliver feeds without permissive CORS
headers causing a PWA to be unable to download them due to security errors.
Electron/Android apps do not have this limitation.

## Compile

    npm install
    npm test
    npm run build
    npm run build -- --release

Note that aside from all the NPM dependencies if you want to compile for Android you need:

- Android SDK with runtime v33.0.2 installed
- env variable set for Android SDK e.g. `export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk`
- gradle 4.4.x

## How to run

Run as a plain PWA (using Cloudflare CORS proxy)

    npx serve          # and access http://localhost:3000/web.html

Run Electron app

    npm start electron             # Run Electron app
    npm start electron --nobuild   # Run without rebuild (much faster)

Run Android app on mobile in developer mode

    npm start android --device

Run Android app in virtual device in Android Studio

    cordova emulate android

Simple Cordova browser debug environment

    npm start browser
