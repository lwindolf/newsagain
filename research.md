## Goals

- an rss reader
- 20 years maintained
  - to allow for this: no framework (React, Vue, ...)
  - vanilla JS only
- no mandatory backend storage (e.g. commercial Feedly, TheOldReader, nor OSS like TTRSS, FreshRSS)
- implemented as progressive web app
- functionality over style

## Runtime Dependencies

- DOMPurify
- handlebars
- handlebars layout
- remotestorage
- remotestorage-widget

## ACAO CORS Solution

### 1. CORS Proxy

As almost noone supplies RSS feeds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` it is impossible to 
build a PWA feed reader without a CORS proxy. Which is quite stupid, as RSS/Atom feeds are intented
to be consumed outside of the website.

Best solution seems to be a CORS proxy using a [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/cors-header-proxy).

Pricing with Cloudflare right now is:
- free plan 1 worker: 100000 req/day
- paid $5 per 10Mio requests/month

By for example limiting the maximum number of subscriptions supported to e.g. 200 and by allowing only 
5 daily updates $5 can serve 10Mio / 200 / 5 / 30 = at least 350 conccurent users which would be a 
reasonable price. The challenge of course lies with preventing abuse of the proxy.

Or use the 
-  anonymous proxy https://corsproxy.io/


### 2. Maintaining CORS injection browser extension

- probably could refer to existing Chrome/Firefox extensions
- fork a simplified extension branded "newsagain"
- using an ACAO extension in a isolated profile would be relatively safe
- hard to/impossible do on mobile

### 3. Apache Cordova (currently preferred option)

- Compile PWA into native app
  - Cordova runs a webview on a non-browser DOM
  - Cordova allows to configure CORS policy for fetched origins
- Supports iOS, Electron (for Linux), Android
  - example apps
- PWA+proxy/extension could be supported along with the Cordova app

Feed readers realized with Electron

- commercial closed-source NorthReader feed reader (Win, MacOS)
- OSS Fluent Reader (all platforms) https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader/
- Raven Reader (Win, Mac, Linux) https://github.com/hello-efficiency-inc/raven-reader
- commercial podcast app https://www.spreaker.com/podcast-recording-software

## Deployment

1. Electron app for desktops
2. Android app in fdroid for mobile
3. (maybe) PWA hosted on lzone.de with proxy support

Revised decision:

1. Use CORS proxy (Cloudflare and maybe others) per default
2. Properly inform users about the security pros and cons
3. Deploy as a simple cross platform PWA without Cordova
